# 2D-Projectile-Motion-Analysis-Python-

#This project takes inputs: 
  #horizontal/vertical acceleration (in component form)
  #a starting position in (x,y) coordinates
  #a velocity vector magnitude (and direction)
  
#And outputs:
  #Total time of flight (time until vertical position = 0)
  #Total horizontal distance (ending position)
  #Final velocity magnitude in unit vector (component) and magnitude/direction forms (velocity right before hitting ground)
  #Maximum height of projectile
  #Time at which maximum height was achieved
